# Business Database

## Introduction

This program is designed as a mockup database that would be used by a company to keep track of employees, roles, departments, and salaries.

## How to use

Running node server.js in the command line will allow you to be brought to a menu. You may view all employees, departments, or roles. You may add a new employee department, or role. You may also update an employee's department to something else.
